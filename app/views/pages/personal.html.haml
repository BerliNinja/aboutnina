%h2 Personal Statement
%p
I am a 25 year old apprentice in application development interested in an internship abroad as a software developer for up to four months.
Until two years ago I had no experience in coding at all (please don't stop reading now) but finishing my Bachelors degree in Urban Planning in 2013 I knew I want to go for something completely new, something extremely challenging and exciting. I decided: if I want to start all over I don't want to go to University again but to learn everything I need hands-on in a company environment.
%p
That is why in 2013 I began an apprenticeship which includes full-time employment in a company (in my case it is http://www.absolventa.de/) and attending college every three to five weeks for one whole week. Until now I don't regret my decision at all but I am quite aware of how much I have to learn. That is why I would love to get the opportunity to broaden my knowledge in another company getting to know other procedures and workings optimally in another cultural environment.
%p
When I applied for my apprenticeship I was lucky to come upon Absolventa the company that decided to hire me even though I had no further experience in coding but were willing to support a young woman to enter the big world of web development. Ruby and Ruby on Rails was a great start for to learn to code and I was lucky to take part in a RailsGirls workshop and visited a ruby conference in Lyon (RuLu) already. That is why I want to deepen my Ruby and RoR skills in a company working with RoR as well as to exchange knowledge and experiences. As I am relatively new to programming I am used to motivate myself, working with new topics and learning a lot within a short time.
%p
So far I contribute to improve my companies official websites by solving front- and backend tasks, including database handling, implementation of front end changes using mainly HAML and SASS, writing migration scripts and much more. I was able to acquire a good understanding of the MVC and how an Rails application functions. In my spare time I try to improve my coding skills as well, recently I started to work on a personal website and try to implement other little projects. From time to time I go to meet-ups listening to talks about related topics. So far I didnt specialize in a subject as our development team is quite small and I have a broad range of tasks to work on which is why I have no specific preferences what to work on exactly but I do want to gain a deeper insight into a specific field.
